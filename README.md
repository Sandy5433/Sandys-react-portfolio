  ## Technology
  React is used in this application to create the interactive UIs. Bootstrap has been used for the Portfolio and Header components of the webpage  
  ## Roadmap
  I am working on adding new features and functions to the web application. The footer currently only links to my GitHub page as I am working on building my LinkedIn and Twitter account. The resume link is also pending to be updated. Contact me form is not yet functional, however, this function will be implemented as I progress through my coding bootcamp.
